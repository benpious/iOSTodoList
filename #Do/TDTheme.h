/**
 An object holding information to theme a view
 
 @note
 Why don't we just use UIApperance proxies? Three reasons
 
 - UIAppearance doesn't update live -- you have to re-add views to the hiearchy to get updates
 
 - It's basically a singleton
 
 - Because of (2), UIAppearance can "bleed" into other processes, particularly App Extensions, and the built-in system keyboard (try setting properties on UITableView while there are multiple keyboards enabled. It is _hilarious_)
