# iOSTodoList
This project _will_ be a To-Do list App demonstrating my coding style and proficiency in various iOS frameworks/technologies. Presently it is not much of anything.

# Planned Usage of iOS Tech
- Fully Utilize `UICollectionView` and its associated objects like `CollectionViewLayout`s to produce cool UI effects 
- Use Core Data for persistence, despite it probably being overkill/absurdly complex

# To build

Honestly, you probably don't want to build it -- right now it doesn't do anything and looks terrible.

If, for some reason, you decide that you _really_ want to see the app, pull the repo, then submodule init/update (yeah, I should probably be using CocaoaPods or Carthage)
